# My First Website - Made in 2007 😱

This is my first experimental website, made in 2007 during some task of my graduation. I've searching for it during a lot of time until finally found in my old email box.

Is really nice and funny imagine me as teenager with 16 years old working about this prototype without know about nothing of the future that was waiting me and as that codes would be responsible to completely change me life in the future 😊

About this project, I realized that I tried use some techniques "fluid layout" almost 15 years ago (I'm writing this text in 2021) and it is really amazing! 😁

Also is interesting look for layout that reflect another time, made for 800x600 resolution and start to think about technologies changes in the World throughout the time.

Do you stopped to think about that we've bought things like DVDs to can watch a movie? 😂

Talking about the code, CSS and HTML have changed a lot but the mainly specifications follows the same:

- HTML care about semantic
- CSS care about styles

Anyway, was really great made this time travel and think about my life as a whole.

Regards ❤️
